## Overview

This initiative documents Chanique's community-facing work: taking visibility gained through pageants and turning it into tangible support for people affected by cancer. The project centers on volunteer mobilization, workshop programming, and fundraising campaigns designed to uplift survivors and their families.

## Programs & Activities

- Volunteer outreach and coordination for local hospitals and care centers.
- "Comfort & Care" resource drives providing practical supplies and respite to families undergoing treatment.
- A series of public workshops titled "Growing Through Adversity" — hosted in community centers to teach stress management, self-care and networking skills.

## Impact

Through local partnerships and grassroots fundraising, Chanique's campaigns have supported multiple families and connected survivors with local counseling and rehabilitation services. The goal is to scale pilot programs into repeatable regional models.
