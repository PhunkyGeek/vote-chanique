## Overview

This initiative documents Chanique's community-facing work: taking visibility gained through pageants and turning it into tangible support for people affected by cancer. The project centers on volunteer mobilization, workshop programming, and fundraising campaigns designed to uplift survivors and their families.

## Programs & Activities

- Volunteer outreach and coordination for local hospitals and care centers.
- "Comfort & Care" resource drives providing practical supplies and respite to families undergoing treatment.
- A series of public workshops titled "Growing Through Adversity" — hosted in community centers to teach stress management, self-care and networking skills.

## Impact

Through local partnerships and grassroots fundraising, Chanique's campaigns have supported multiple families and connected survivors with local counseling and rehabilitation services. The goal is to scale pilot programs into repeatable regional models.

## Join the Movement

If your organization is interested in partnering, hosting a workshop, or sponsoring resource drives, please reach out using the contact details on the About page. Collaborative support is essential to expand access and deepen impact.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma API**: For extracting design tokens and component data directly from the Figma designs.
- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Styled-Components**: For managing styles dynamically using design tokens.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the generated code was clean and maintainable. This involved setting up intelligent mapping between Figma components and React code structures, as well as managing edge cases like responsive design and conditional rendering. Additionally, the continuous synchronization required a robust error-handling system to prevent conflicts during development.

## Outcome

The automated Figma to code pipeline has streamlined the handoff process, cutting down design-to-development time by 40%. Designers now have more confidence that their designs will be accurately translated into code, and developers can focus on more complex logic and feature development. This project has proven the value of automation in bridging the gap between design and development.


This project demonstrates your ability to leverage automation and streamline workflows, which is highly relevant for design engineering portfolios focused on efficiency and innovation.
